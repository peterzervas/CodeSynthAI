Test Plan Outline for Space Invaders Game

1. Test Case: Validate Player Movement
- Description: Ensure the player can move left and right within the game boundaries.
- Expected Outcome: Player moves accurately in response to input without crossing boundaries.

2. Test Case: Validate Bullet Firing
- Description: Confirm that bullets are fired from the player's position and move vertically upwards.
- Expected Outcome: Bullets are generated and move as expected, disappearing upon reaching the top of the screen or hitting an enemy.

3. Test Case: Validate Game Loop
- Description: Verify that the game loop correctly handles game start, progression, and end states.
- Expected Outcome: Game starts, progresses through levels or waves of enemies, and ends appropriately upon player defeat or completion of all levels.

Note: Due to tool limitations, actual execution of these test cases cannot be performed. This outline represents the planned approach for testing the Space Invaders game functionality.
