- Collision detection (projectiles with enemies, enemies with player)
- Score tracking
- Life system
- Level progression
- Sound effects (shooting, explosions, background music)

## Technologies and Modules
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library for game development

## Detailed Specifications
### Player
- The player controls a spaceship located at the bottom of the screen.
- The spaceship can move left and right within the game window.
- The player can shoot projectiles to destroy enemies.

### Enemies
- Enemies appear in waves at the top of the screen and move horizontally and vertically down.
