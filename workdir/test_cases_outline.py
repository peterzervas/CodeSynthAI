Test Cases for Space Invaders Game

This document outlines the conceptual test cases for testing the Space Invaders game developed using the Pygame library. The game includes functionalities such as player movement, shooting projectiles, enemy waves, collision detection, score tracking, life system, level progression, and sound effects.

1. Player Movement
- Test moving the player left and right within the game boundaries.
- Test that the player cannot move beyond the game boundaries.

2. Shooting Projectiles
- Test shooting projectiles and their movement on the screen.
- Test the limit on the number of projectiles on the screen at any time.

3. Enemy Character Movement
- Test the movement patterns of enemy characters.
- Test the increasing difficulty in enemy movement as levels progress.

4. Collision Detection
- Test collision detection between projectiles and enemies.
- Test collision detection between enemies and the player.
- Test collision detection with game boundaries.

5. Performance Optimization
- Test the game's performance under different system loads.
- Test for any memory leaks or performance bottlenecks.

6. User Interface and Feedback
- Test the responsiveness of the user interface.
- Test the accuracy of score tracking and life system.
- Test level progression feedback.

This framework serves as a guideline for developing detailed test cases and executing them to ensure the reliability, performance, and correctness of the generated code.
