## Test Plan for Game

### Unit Tests
- **Objective**: Ensure individual functions in `game_mechanics.py` and `game_updates.py` work as expected.
- **Method**: Use Python's `unittest` framework to write tests for each function. Mock dependencies as needed.

### Integration Tests
- **Objective**: Verify that components interact correctly.
- **Method**: Test the interaction between functions in `game_mechanics.py` and `game_updates.py`, using `unittest.mock` to simulate components.

### End-to-End Tests
- **Objective**: Simulate real user scenarios.
- **Method**: Use `selenium` for Python to automate user interactions with the game's UI.

### Performance Tests
- **Objective**: Assess game performance under various conditions.
- **Method**: Utilize `locust` or `pytest-benchmark` to simulate high load scenarios and measure response times.

### User Experience Tests
- **Objective**: Evaluate UI, feedback mechanisms, and overall experience.
- **Method**: Manual testing guided by UX principles, and automated UI tests with `selenium`.

Each test case will document expected inputs, outputs, and steps. The plan will adapt as more is learned about the specific game code.
