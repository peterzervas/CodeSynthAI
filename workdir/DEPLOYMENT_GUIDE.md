# Deployment Guide

This guide outlines the steps necessary to prepare the game project for deployment and handover to the customer.

## Preparing the Project

1. Ensure that all Python files, including `game_mechanics.py` and `game_updates.py`, are up to date and have been reviewed for efficiency, readability, and adherence to best practices.

2. Confirm that all code is well-documented, with clear comments and docstrings for maintainability.

3. Organize the code into appropriate files and directories.

## Packaging the Game

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all the Python dependencies needed for the project. This can be generated using the command `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your project environment.

2. Package the game into a distributable format, such as a ZIP file, ensuring all necessary files are included.

## Final Steps

1. Perform a final test of the game to ensure everything is working as expected.

2. Provide the customer with the packaged game, `requirements.txt`, and this deployment guide.

## Handover

1. Schedule a meeting with the customer to hand over the project and walk them through the deployment process and how to run the game.

2. Ensure the customer has all the information they need to successfully deploy and run the game.
